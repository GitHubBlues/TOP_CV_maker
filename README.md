## **CV-maker**

My first React application, a simple top project for learning about react components and states. It is implemented with classes (main branch) and with functions (useHooks branch). 

The app was developed in the context of Odin's Project, as indicated in the [project specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application).
